# azure-selenium-webscraper
Docker instance of a Selenium web scraper hosted on Azure Functions that pushed to a Webflow site via its API.
Set-up the Azure infrastructure according to <a href="https://github.com/rebremer/azure-function-selenium"> this repo </a>. All credits on setting-up a functioning Dockerised instance on Azure Functions go to the creator.
<br><br>
This web scraper builds on the above app by adding scraping functionality that is triggered to run on a scheduled basis. Scraped content is then pushed to a Webflow frontend using its API.
<br><br>
To use the Webflow functionality, modify the webflow.py file to add the relevant API key and collection IDs.
